screen shots were taken running staroffice in solaris express developers edition 79b everything was under the default conditions i have observed reported in the opensolarisorg i18n forum the same problems in all versions of solaris express including sxce as well as from running openofficeorg in solaris express up to inclusive of version i have been using solaris express desktops for more than two years the only situation where i did not see chinese font garbling when running under system default conditions is when i ran starsuite in the chinese locale however even in the chinese locale the font garbling problem would reappear if i change the default system font to say arial note since i could find the tab to include the abovementioned screenshots please go to opensolarisorg i18n forum

623	1307	make net the default and only installation option	the subject of making net the default installation setting was discussed on the discuss mailing list last week see the why net is needed thread from the middle of july basically to summarize nearly everyone please read the archives do nt take my word for it agreed that the current net install was nonoptimal i suggested removing it altogether and making the default behavior be a net install s vesik suggested having a radio button in the installation program that would allow you to choose a net installation or not he was also afraid that ooo would lose some functionality by removing net that people may get confused by the effect of having or not a common location for the config files sander i hope i summarized your points well i realize now that this discussion probably should have been occuring here which is why i opened this issue it seems to me that the only difference between a net install and a nonnet install is whether the configuration files are installed within the directory structure of the program files as in the case of a nonnet install or the config files are stored seperately from the application files as in a net install my thesis is the following if we default to a net install always we can have both behaviors location of config files relative to apps in a natural and simple manner when you install ooo have it always do a net install then you would always have to run setup to build your config files if you performed both steps as the same user and choose to install ooo into openoffice6 you will have your config files and apps in the same location if you installed ooo as a privileged user and then run setup as a different user you will have the apps and config files separate this is the way most all other applications work and it would make ooo s installation much simpler in fact i do nt think any of this really needs to be explained to people they simply choose where to install the apps and the rest falls out as a natural consequence of that choice for example if i want to install mozilla for my own personal use i install it into mozilla i do nt need to talk to the sysadm of the system and i have complete control of the application if i want to install it as a shared app for all the users of the system i will need to as root install it into usrlocalmozilla for example and give the users rx access to those files then when i run the app for the first time it sets up my personal config files it is simple as it is the way most applications function comments	1940	1940	remove net option better and easier behaviour	staroffice supports singleuser and multiuser environments currently the singleuser is default and the user has to use the net option for enabling the multiuser mode before installing as several mails in the mailing lists show this is a very irritating behaviour nearly no user finds the net option himself i do nt any other program doing it that way so a user simply does nt expect it and gets surprised if so does nt work which hurts the first using experience badly when using the multiuser install every user has to start the setup program themself which also hurts the user experience badly since one can not expect a user to know that we must remove the net option and the per user setup and replace both by a better easier to understand behaviour is it necessary to make a difference between the multiuser and the singleuser install a user expects that if he installs a software he and everyone else can use it so what is so special about the single user mode if a difference is needed we have a gui installer why do we have to give it the net option as a parameter for the program it should be possible to choose this function in the gui installer together with a small description which explain it to the average user it is possible to choose the install size something like default minimize custom i think that the logical place for asking for the net option is just before that dialog currently each user has to manualy start the setup program before he can use sooo the first time if sooo can find the configuration files it should be able to find out if the setup program was already executed before if it was not then start the setup program if point should go into a new issue then i would file it

807	29466	very difficult to modify chart once drawn	i find the charting tool in ooo spreadsheet very frustrating to use there appear to be two types of selection one gives green handles and lets me edit the data series although only by redefining them as a whole data range there is no analogue of the dialogues in competing products that let you alter names and ranges individually the other type of selection gives an outline box and lets you use the menus to edit the appearance of the chart object the line style or even the type of chart i suspect this comes about because the chart object is a separate module and the interface to the spreadsheet is not the same as the interface to the drawing setup but it is counterintuitive and clumsy and switching from one type of selection to another is not possible without deselecting a completely nonobvious action i have used both quattro and excel and the ease of chart modification in both is superior i am sure i could get used to clumsy techniques in ooo but that does not mean they are not clumsy	20344	20344	simplify creation of charts new chart wizard autoformat chart dialog	source berkeley see http wwwsimsberkeleyeducoursesis271f01projectsstarcalcfinalreportpdf product requirement more discoverable way to add chart and less steps in the process customer needproblem too many steps required to create chart in calc people sometimes do not complete all steps or simply took too long also placement of icons on left toolbar was not visible to users product concept editing a chart will work by clicking directly on a chart object ie you do no longer have to make a doubleclick to activate the chart and the click again to select furthermore the order of the tabpages in the autopilot must be changed currently the first page shows the cellrange of the spreadsheet which a user rarely needs to modify the second page is the most important one where you can select the chart type the order of these two pages should be exchanged when a user has triggered the creation of a chart with a click on the toolbar he has to define where the chart will be placed as first step many users are puzzled by this behaviour instead the autopilot needs to appear first after the user finished the autopilot the chart will be automatically placed like it happens when he triggered the creation of the chart with the menu item insertchart functional specification

1035	80597	background color of text can not be changed from ms word	when i set the background color of text save the file in word format open it up in word and set the background color of that text to no fill it stays the same color that i set it to in oo writer if i want to change the background color i have to go back to oo writer to do so	9072	9072	highlighting can not be removed in document exported to ms word	create new document write some text highlight them export this document as microsoft word 972000xp open this document in ms word i ve used wordxp try to remove highlighting nothing happens it is possible to change highlighting to other color but removing highlighting in ms word causes original color assigned in openoffice	
1036	97018	entering multiple values no matrix	in some other well known spreadsheet application it is possible to enter the value for say cells by selecting those cells entering the value into one cell and by pressing ctrlenter afterwards this is a very efficient facility when it comes to filling empty cells with a default value and is very handy in many other occasions too	7357	7357	paste into nonadjacent random cells	can only paste clipboard into multiple cells if selected adjacent to each other and selected in same row or column should be able to randomly select nonadjacent cells either individually or in groups and paste clipboard contents into them same applies to setting cell properties this capability is available in quattro pro and excel and frequently used by many of us	
1037	47243	polygons automatically closed in presentation view	if you insert a polygon in a presentation it is shown not closed but if you switch to presentation view the polygon is shown like a closed polygon with a line from the starting point to the endpoint the same effect occurs with connectors in my german version they are called verbinder	37793	37793	line polygons have extra lines	mismatch for openclosed polygons on both canvas implementations see eg presentation organigramm or fs3 windows terminal server page	
1038	44271	extra line in display of charts in impress	in the previewedit views of the charts in this presentation the charts look fine however in the slide show an extra line is added from the first data point to the last data point this is the same presenation as in issue but a different although similar issue i have also attached the original calc file from which the charts were taken i do nt know if it helps both files created in ooo although maybe the calc file was first created in i do nt remember thanks	37793	37793	line polygons have extra lines	mismatch for openclosed polygons on both canvas implementations see eg presentation organigramm or fs3 windows terminal server page

1136	52893	using brochure format for printing	i ve tried using the brochure format to produce a5sized booklets from a4 sheets of paper but i ca nt work whether i m doing it wrong or the program is doing it wrongly when i try to print an a4 sheet in brochure format i tend to get a6sized pages in the topleft and topright corners of my printout if i m doing it wrongly could you explain brochure format better in the help documentation because if i ca nt understand it i m not sure what cahnce the average layman has if it s a bug can you fix it if it s any use i m using the 19m117 build from fedora core alternatively could you bring back the pages per sheet option that was in openoffice but seems to have disappeared from the new version	16745	16745	make creating a booklet wysiwyg	i looked for booklet in issues and found issue and issue both of which are resolved as worksforme both of these issues describe the desire for booklet printing and both explain how to go about getting however the solution is to get booklet format by shrinking the page down from x in portrait mode to something that fits on half a 85x11 page in landscape although i was excited to see that i can create a booklet there are several usability problems the obvious one is that it is nt easy to find searching for booklet in help yields nothing after finding the above two issues i found that the print option is brochure although the functionality seems very similar i tend to think of brochures as sheet of paper whereas a booklet can be multiple sheets i think that the difference is important in terms of the enhancement i am requesting the second usability problem is the user ca nt see what the output will look like until it is printed because the solution is to shrink the print so that it will fit print preview does not even show what the pages will look like because the functionality is not applied until it is being sent to the printer therefore the user must create the page using enlarged graphics and font sizes print in brochure mode remembering to change the print settings to landscape and then look at the output before they know whether or not the brochurebooklet is viewable changing the page size using the format menu option does nt work because it does nt stop the print functionality from shrinking the enhancement then is to make creating a bookletbrochure part of the formatting prior to printing for a booklet the page dimensions should be changed so that it fits on half a page but while editing the document flows from page to page as it does today the print mechanism would automatically order and print the half pages so that the pages can be arranged and folded into a book however a brochure would be easier to visualize if there were two pages with columns set up where the text flowed from one column to another column in the order that makes sense for the brochure when i have created brochures in the past using open office i have simply set up text frames in the columns where i wanted the information to be my kids have had to create mini books for school projects and not knowing about the brochure setting it has been really painful to try and get the pages to layout the way that i wanted having only played with the brochure setting i can see where although the setup would be easier usability could still be improved

1457	79191	rows alignment getting distracted when merging cells	i was working on tables in openoffice when i merged cells in a particular column the alignment of rows in the columns next to the merged column got changed ie the rows left to the merged column are having one alignment and that of right are having one alignment you can get a clear picture of this when you give it a try when i checked this in contentxml i found that the main table is having a single row with cells first cell is having a table with property table subtype yes second cell is a single cell third cell is again a table with property table subtype yes it might be a bit weird to say but msword is maintaining the row alignment intact over the merged column i am not trying to point out	73824	73824	cellsize behind merged cells differs from size of cells in same row before merged cells	hi in tables in writer where you have cells before and behind merged cells horizontal merged cells the cells behind the merged cells differs in the cellheigh from the cells before the merged cells in openoffice calc the cell high before and behind a merged cell are the same means the rowsize before and behind the merged cell stays the same like it was before the merged cell that behavoiur is not nice but not critically because everyone could change the heigh of the cells by hand again but it takes time and nervs and normally the users want that the rowheigh before and behind merged cells is the same hope you got me and understand the problem i add a examplefocument which shows this behaviour i just created a table after that i merged the cells in the collumn in the middle and the result was what you see now in the document greets jan mailerdemon

1460	110115	document viewer	in my opinion it would be a good idea to implement a small tool for just viewingreading ooo documents as odt ods pdf and so on without any editing capabilities this would be useful for fast presentation and if you just wan na read a document on your monitor with better performance and without the large editing toolset especially there is also no way to view your exported pdf documents without the use of additional software the use of the pdfimport plugin is no real alternative because it takes minutes to open a pdf file and is not always displaying every document correctly	2762	2762	an openoffice file format viewer would be very convenient when viewing openoffice documents on other computers without oo	i sometimes save documents in sxw format but then need to access them at my high school at which software installation is not permitted thus a small application to view openoffice files would be very convenient for me and i m sure many others

1571	52363	ime hanja key should invoke single character conversion instead of hangulhanja conversion	korean users sometimes need to convert korean characters into chinese ones typically korean ime implements such a function and it is bound to ime hanja key in addition to this starsuiteooo implements hangulhanja conversion function basically this function operates on words instead of single character it uses custom dictionary to find suggestions for conversion unfortunately this is not so useful in ooo because ooo does not have the dictionary in short ime hanja key is for single character and hangulhanja conversion is for words both have their own purpose depending on users need however the behavior of ime hanja key is very odd in ooo may be in starsuite too right after user finish to input single korean character ime hanja key works as expected i am going to attach the screenshot however once user move caret from the character and come back later ime hanja key always invokes hangulhanja conversion the point is that user expect single character conversion when they push ime hanja key currently this only works before caret leaves the character this should be fixed so that user can do single character conversion whenever they push hanja key this gets more odd in english version of windows ime assign right ctrl key for hanja conversion when user push the key ooo shows window from ime first and shows hangulhanja conversion dialog immediately it seems to be a problem in windows event hooking of ooo	55356	55356	impossible to use ime s single character hangulhanja conversion instead of ooo s	note this might look similar to issue ime hanja key should invoke single character conversion http qaopenofficeorgissuesshowbugcgi id52363 it s not i use windows xp dede where i have installed korean fonts and a global input method editor ime for korean as is freely available for all windows versions since as has been described in issue whenever a user types hangeul and presses ctrl when using the global ime on nonkorean windows or the hanja key on korean systems ooo kills the global ime s or the korean windows builtin ime s hanja single character conversion popup and instead pops up its own hangulhanja conversion dialog in ooo beta i have nt tried beta2 yet this dialog s suggestions box will be empty by default once the user has ticked the replace by character checkbox it will list hanja candidates as i understand it issue merely demands that replace by character be checked by default after all having it unchecked would not make sense unless ooo gets starsuite s hanja dictionary i feel there should be a preference in ooo allowing the user to set which of the following should happen by default when the ctrl key or hanja key is pressed a ooo s conversion dialog pops up or b the global ime s or korean windows ime s list pops up steps to reproduce a on korean windows in ooo options enable enhanced support for asian languages open a text document in ooo type anything in hangeul need not be a complete hanja syllable press hanja key on keyboard actual result ooo s hangulhanja conversion dialog pops up suggesting nothing unless replace by character is enabled expected result depending on how you have set a preference in the ooo option s language settings either the ooo s dialog pops up or windows builtin ime s hanja conversion is allowed to pop up b on nonkorean windows install support for korean from microsoftcom in ooo options enable enhanced support for asian languages open a text document in ooo type anything in hangeul need not be a complete hanja syllable press ctrl key on keyboard actual result ooo s hangulhanja conversion dialog pops up suggesting nothing unless replace by character is enabled expected result depending on how you have set a preference in the ooo option s language settings either the ooo s dialog pops up or the global ime s hanja conversion is allowed to pop up currently the only way to suppress ooo s annoying popup is disabling enhanced language support for asian languages which strongly decreases functionality if you are curious as to why a windows user might prefer global ime s hanja conversion over ooo s have a look at http wwwopenofficeorgnonavissuesshowattachmentcgi28160hanjaimepng the part of the image labeled microosft office shows how the global ime s hanja conversion looks like a small popup appears above or below the caret or in the screen s lower right corner it uses screen real estate efficiently shows hanja at a time with those most frequently used on top and those least used accessible by scrolling down you can select one by either clicking on it or typing the number shown next to it each hanja is clearly distinguishable and has its korean name and pronunciation next to it to help the user decide none of the above applies to ooo s huge dinosaur of a dialog which you can see labeled openofficeorg in the abovementioned image and ooo s dialog has few advantages over the ime s ps not sure whether this issue affects other parts of ooo as well it was only writer in also not sure whether this would be a mere enhancement but it completely breaks ooo for use with hanja for me

1648	10845	error indicators mess up scaling	included my data at the bottom xydiagrams with symbols and lines but that does not matter if you try to assign a constant error of to the values the scaling of the diagram grows large and you have to rescale the diagramm it is not possible to chose constant values smaller than no matter what values you have makes the indicators pretty useless for small values eg molefractions and statistics are between and features really missing indicators for x values different types of indicators my data features really missing indicators for x values different types of indicators	9279	9279	error bars need more functionality	the error bar function on the chart feature is not well implemented at present it is an important function for use in science and business and so is in my opinion worth developing at present the error bars follow a similar structure to ms excel although it should be noted that excel imported charts do not display error bars correctly the way they work at present is actually quite useless you can select standard deviations etc but the error bars display a standard deviation of the plotted bar values ie if you have bars of values and the error bars will be the standard deviation of these three values and will be the same for each bar what is actually needed is a standard deviation or better a confidence interval of the values which are averaged to get the value of each bar in the first place the error bars should be of different sizes on each of the bars depending on the sd of the data for which the value of the bar is the mean this will require at least two extra features firstly to be able to plot the mean of values as one point in a chart rather than just having to work out the mean and then plotting that and secondly to allow different error bar sizes depending on the sd of the data from which the mean was obtained if this feature was implemented it would put the chart function of open office head and shoulders above excel excel does allow you to specify different error bar sizes for each data point but you have to work out the sd or sem within the spreadsheet and then point to these values from the error bar section being able to select sd standard error of mean or confidence interval directly from the chart section would be a vast improvement look at something like sigmaplot for the way it should be done regards james stone	8877.0

1704	23402	openoffice should indicate when it is using fontglyph substitutionfallback	this is more a usability problem then a code defect right now if the user selects a font which does not have the appropiate glyphs for the language typed for example selecting bitstream vera and then typing in hebrew oo slintly uses font substitution without notifing the user this is one if not the most common causes for users in israel to complain about strange behavier with hebrew in oo is that they are using a font with no hebrew glyphs without relising it oo automaticly kicks in with font substitution without any indication in most cases changing the font to a true hebrew font fixes the problems they see if oo would have indicated to the user somehow that the font they selected is not the one used in practice and that there is font substitution going on many user problems would be prevented	45128	45128	silent failing is bad practice font fallback and glyph fallback	silently failing is bad practice items should not silently fail fonts should not silently fall back in a recent example my bitstream charter 10cpi fell back to something that looked like comic sans if the default action is to fall back on error then it should be obvious to the user that the action is a default and not deceptive to the user as misnaming the font truly used i have two ideas on how to fix this problem a simply make the font name truly represent the font used if font foo isn t on the system and it falls back to font bar then it should label the font in the interface bar and not foo b or continue to mislabel the font foo but make it evident to the user that this is an automated best ditch effort to deliver what the user wants this could be easily accomplished by coloring the background of the font name on the formatting toolbar a light shade of red and applying a simple bubble notice when the user drags the cursor over the name the logic behind this more incognito notification is when the user realizes what is wrong the first places he will look is the font bar and notice its red background a scheme as such could be used on all parts of the formatting bar evan carroll http wwwevancarrollcom

2060	60053	captioning in frames is defective	captioning in frame is defective note after raising issue i conducted some experiments and found that the problem is more fundamental in fact it is related to how caption is treated within a frame since this is no more related to linked frames i am raising this issue separately in fact captions in frames suffer from multiple problems you can enter any number of captions in a single frame just select the caption command from the context menu and go on entering new strings all of these captions will add up in the same frame writer does not block this neither does it prompt you whether to replace the existing caption when you are in a frame that already has a caption the caption dialog does not serve as a caption editor it does not reflect the current caption which you can edit whatever you enter in the caption dialog goes to the frame as a new additional caption the only way to edit the caption is to click inside the frame and edit it you can click inside the frame and edit the caption like any other text if you see the caption context menu after that the new changes are not reflected in fact the field remains blank you can click anywhere around the caption and add text before or after it after such editing your caption can be easily lost in the text in other words captions are neither protected nor set apart so that they can stand out in comparison with the contents of the frame you can click inside the frame and delete a caption again the caption dialog will not show any difference	40957	40957	improved caption management	as can be seen by other issues issue about caption moving issue about deletion and other caption management can be improved i ll try to describe at least first steps to improve caption handling if caption dialog is open for an object that already has caption edit current caption instead of creating another are there cases when two captions are needed for single object this would allow easy changing caption text cathegory location without completely recreating it and cutting object out of frame pasting it etc add before and after fields in caption properties just like in outline numbering for example in some languages it is common to add letters nr that represent number before the number itself some languages require a dot after numerals how fortunate i need them both this would also be a workaround so that categories containing spaces could be imitated probably these afterbefore fields should be common for category btw only before should be created anew separator already acts as after to resolve issue i would suggest adding a button remove similar to one in numbering properties which completely removes caption and frame so that picture is the way it was before adding caption

document date with wrong format	ok i think that this date and time in a macro thing is a bug here is what i do to make the macro i click on tools macro record macro i click on the toolbar button to center my text i click on insert fields other and then i select the type of date that i want leaving it set as fixed i close the fields box which is what was opened up to select the type of date i want i put in tabs i click on insert fields other and then i select the type of time that i want leaving it set as fixed i close the fields box i hit enter twice to give me a blank line and put the cursor on a second line i click on the left justify button on the toolbar to left justify my text i click on stop recording macro and name my macro ok in past versions of open office this worked great when done exactly as i described above the following examples just are nt formatting the way i use them any time i opened up a new document i could run this macro and get the date and time in the format i wanted for example fri october pm when i first record the macro in ver it works great in the document i recorded it in can use it repeatedly and it works can save the document and open it later and it works fine but in a new document it puts in the raw data like it also does this in a document that i create the macro in and use the macro in and it works great in the document as long as it is in open office writer format but if i use save as and save the document in another format such as rtf then it does nt work again it puts the data in raw format now i have found a workaround you use the macro in a new document it puts the data in as raw data but spaced and everything the way you wanted it you select one of the fields and right click and on the popup menu that comes up you select fields and go back and reselect the date in the format you want and click on ok at this point it does nt change it back it stays as the raw data format then you click on view field names now the fields go to this format date fixed time fixed ok now you go back and click on view field names which deselects viewing as field names again and after you do this it changes back but instead of the raw data format you get the date in the format you want and the time in the format you want spaced and laid out the way you wanted it to of course this is a lot of steps to go through in a document where you might only want to use the date and time once better to just insert the data and insert the time laying it out in whatever arrangement you want to have it in manually lot less work and a lot less steps i tried doing the macro in a blank new document erase everything and then save that document as the default document but this does nt work as a workaround you get the raw data and have to go through the workaround i described above the following is the macro text you get when you click on edit in the macro window begin macro code rem basic sub main end sub sub datetime rem rem

2469	115278	word completion needs ignore all caps option legal documents	guys word completion is very useful but it is horribly annoying for lawyers and staff because there is no option to ignore words in all caps traditionally all legal pleadings and other documents will have the style top of document with cause number parties court information and pleading title done in all caps of course all of this information will be used many times again below in normal case word completion is horribly flawed in this situation because it has no option to ignore the first occurrence of the words in all caps that make up the style of the document which causes oowriter to suggest the words in all caps the next times they are used in the body of the document practically rendering word completion useless in this situation currently the only way to fix word completion is to go manually delete each instance of the collected words that are in all caps from the word completion list this is unworkable and both staff and attorneys usually just end up retyping all the words again in proper case when word completion keeps proposing the word in all caps over and over again simply adding an option to word completion to ignore words in all caps would solve this issue completely and make oowriter much more usable in the legal setting the code in oo already exists in the spell checker to ignore words in all caps this logic just needs to be added to the word completion feature as well and a checkbox added to the word completion dialog to ignore words in all caps please consider incorporating this as soon as practicable it would really help acceptance of oowriter in many areas but especially in the legal field	22961	22961	autocomplete unable to differentiate between capital letters and small letters	if autocomplete first included the word completion into its list the next time when one type complet ooo will suggset completion and vice versa this is extremely ackward and greatly limiting this function s usability
